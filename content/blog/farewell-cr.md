It has been almost ten years to the day since Sarah and I first arrived in Cedar Rapids to work with Pearson Education and it is with a mix of emotions that we say farewell.

My work with Pearson has been the most satisfying and stretching work experience I have had to date. I am grateful to have worked with professionals who strive for excellence in their daily work and who have taught me much about the craft of software development and continuous improvement—for which I am deeply grateful. With sadness I bid farewell to the many people who have made my experience at Pearson the joy it has been to me in these past ten years.

On October 24 I will assume a new role as Lead Developer with [Urbancode](http://www.urbancode.com) of Cleveland, Ohio—a maker of build, release, and deployment management tools which has earned recognition from Gartner and others as a leader in the field. The challenge of creating products which improve the efficiency of software development teams and are offered for sale in the marketplace as well as the prospect of mentoring software developers in a small firm excites my entrepreneurial instincts. Despite the considerable disruption this move will be to the happiness my family and I have known in Cedar Rapids, the opportunity seems too perfect a fit to pass by.

In ten years we’ve put down deep roots in Iowa. Our church family, our Cedar Rapids friends and our home school co-op and assistance program have been a tremendous blessing to us. Thanks to all who have made this last decade one of joy and growth. You are dearly loved and will be sorely missed.
