At [ic-ruby](http://groups.google.com/group/ic-ruby) on Thursday we talked about XML and JSON parsing and object mapping. I shared a little about how we are using [ROXML](https://github.com/Empact/roxml) at Pearson and Wesley Beary shared how [Fog](https://github.com/geemus/fog) uses Nokogiri's SAX support for performance but incurs maintenance overhead as a result. Perhaps we can have it all: Greg's [post](http://blog.gregweber.info/posts/2011-06-03-high-performance-rb-part1) shows how with [sax-machine](https://github.com/pauldix/sax-machine).
