Today we had trouble firing up autotest on a Rails 3 project. Adding the following to our .autotest file seemed to solve the problem.

    class Autotest::Rspec2 < Autotest
        def make_test_cmd(files_to_test)
            files_to_test.empty? ? '' :
                "bundle exec rspec --tty " \
                "#{normalize(files_to_test).keys.flatten.map{|f| "'#{f}'"}.join(' ')}"
        end
    end
